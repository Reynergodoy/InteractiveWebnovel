Strenghtening his resolve, he moves in a seemingly random direction. Only the boy knew where he was going. Only the boy knew his motives.' });

Was it despair? Why? After a few minutes of walking towards his goal, the boy felt warmth. He saw, afar, smoke rising from the village. The little kid knew he had to be fast, and so was what he did, he started running towards his goal. After a few minutes he passed through the gates of his village, that were wide open.' });
      novel.addScene('terror', { choices: { resolve: 'Next'}, description: '\'Why? Why? Why did this happen?\'. Looking inside the village, what he saw left him in pure terror, all the village was burnt, nothing was in one piece, all bodies were carbonized, there was blood everywhere, no one was left alive. The kid slumped down on the ground, blood soaked his trousers while he silently mourned for the death. The village became a desert, a bloody scorching desert' });
      novel.addScene('resolve', { description: 'After what seemed a few hours, the boy\'s clogged mind became clearer. In his mind ruthless thoughts appeared, he made up his resolve, he would make whoever did this pay, with their lives' });
